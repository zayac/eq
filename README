Eq is a stream-based functional language designed for solving numerical tasks.
The syntax of the Eq programming language is based on a document preparation
system LaTeX. It follows that source files of the Eq can be interpreted by any
LaTeX conversion tool (i.e. pdflatex, latex2html, etc.).
The current version uses Python as a backend language.

In order to build the compiler do the following:
  $ cd build/
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

CMake cache variables can be defined:
  -DBUILD_LEXER=[ON|OFF]	  = Select either to build the lexer only.
  -DBACKEND_LANG=[python|haskell] = Select compiler's backend.

In case you want to run a test bundle:
  $ ctest
or
  $ make test

It's possible to execute tests separately:
  $ ctest -R run_test		| Tests compilation of a correct syntax on
				| different stages (parser, type checking 
				| and code generating).
  $ ctest -R fail_test		| Tests invalid syntax processing and error
				| handing.
  $ ctest -R exec_test		| Validates the output of the compiler.
  $ ctest -R memory_test	| Looks for memory leaks in the compiler.
