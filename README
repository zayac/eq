In order to build the compiler do the following:
  $cd build/
  $cmake ..
  $make

CMake cache variables can be defined:
  -DBUILD_LEXER=[ON|OFF]	  = Select either to build the lexer only.
  -DBACKEND_LANG=[python|haskell] = Select compiler's backend.

In case you want to test the binary run:
  $make test
