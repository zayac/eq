@cindex Eq
@cindex functional language
@cindex stream processing
Eq is a stream-based functional language designed for solving numerical tasks.
The syntax of the Eq programming language is based on a document preparation
system LaTeX. It follows that source files of the Eq can be interpreted by any
LaTeX conversion tool (i.e. pdflatex, latex2html, etc).


@ignore
@c man begin SYNOPSIS
@eq{} [@option{-help}] [@option{-I}@var{dir}@dots{}]

The most useful options are listed here; see below for the remainder.
@c man end

@c man begin SEEALSO

@c man begin AUTHOR
The language is currently developed by Pavel Zaichenkov and Artem
Shinkarov.

The @eq compiler compiles from a latex-based syntax files into the
executables.

@node Overall options
@section General options

When one of the following options is called @eq{} does not perform
any compilation.

@cindex overall optiona
@table @tabopt

@item -V
@opindex V
Print the version of the compiler.

@end table


@node Print options
@section Print options
These options are used to print a state of the program after a certain
phase of the compiler.

@table @tabopt

@item -P @var{phase}
@opindex P


@var{phase} is a name of the phase after which compiler would stop
its execution and print the state of the abstract syntax tree to 
standard output.

@itemize
@item @b{program}
stop after the parsing phase.
@item @b{types}
stop after the type-checking phase.
@item @b{matches}
stop after used-defined matches resolution.
@end itemize
@end table


@node Break options
@section Break options
Break options allow you to stop the compilation process after a
particular phase.

@cindex break options
@table @tabopt

@item -B @var{phase}
@opindex B 
Break after a phase defined by @var{phase}, which can have the following
values.

@itemize
@item @b{parser}
Stop after the parsing phase.
@end itemize

@chapter Reporting bugs
If you found a bug or inconsistency in the documentation, please open a new
issue on the github.  In order to do so, pleae use the following web-page:
@url{https://github.com/zayac/eq/issues/}.


@node Getting help
@chapter Getting help
In case you are stuck, please contact one of the authors of the project by
means of github messaging, or by e-mails.  The e-mails are available at the
front page of the project.


@node Contributing to Eq
@chapter Contributing to Eq
If you wish to contribute to the project, then the easiest way would be to
obtain the code, implementa a certain feature, and make a pull-request.

The code is hosted on the github.  In order to just get the code, you can run:
@smallexample
        git clone git@@github.com:zayac/eq.git
@end smallexample

In order to do a pull request, you have to fork a repository, make some
changes on your forked branch, and commit it via pull-request.  The
procedure is well described in git-help:
@url{https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo}.
