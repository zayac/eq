% The testcase tests if the parser correctly prints error-messages
% about the missing lines, without braking somewhere else.
%
% FIXME currently the lexer jumps to the next line when it
% tries to find \lend, so the error-annotations must occur ther
% as well, otherwise the line number would not match.  I don't have
% a good fix right now.

\begin{eqcode}{testif}{f}{\type{Z}}{\type{Z}}
	a \gets 5 \lend
	x \gets 6				
	y \gets b \lend			% eq-error: token `\lend' expected
	a \gets 3				
\end{eqcode}				% eq-error: token `\lend' expected
